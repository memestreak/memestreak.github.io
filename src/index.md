# Index Header

This is markdown content. This is a bunch of content that makes it
easy to tell whether I like a particular font or style
configuration. Bear with me while I blabber on.

## More Stuff {.c-article-section__title}

More content appears in a second paragraph. An [embedded link] is also
helpful to verify layout behavior.[^1]

Let's do a quick list!
*   First thing
*   Another thing

Embedded code would be good to verify as well.

```sh
# wow a shell comment
echo "Neat"
```

[^1]: Omg this is a footnote.
